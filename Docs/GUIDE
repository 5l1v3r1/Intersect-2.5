											[ Create.py Application ]

The Create application is the core application within the Intersect 2.5 framework.
The main focus of Create is to help you in building customized Intersect scripts, but it can also be used for importing
new modules from a local file or webserver, viewing their descriptions or author information, check for updates to the
Intersect framework and some other creation-centric features.

Create.py is a menu-driven script that guides you through the process of building your custom script.
When you start Create you will be brought to the Main Menu, where you can choose whether to build a new script, import
a new module or view a list of all currently available modules within the Custom and Standard directories.

Within any menu of Create, you can type ':help' to be presented with a detailed list of commands for the specific menu
you are in. You can also type ':exit' or ':quit' at any menu to be brought back to the Main Menu or completely exit
the application, if you are all ready there.

Main Menu:
	1 => Create Custom Script
	2 => List Available Modules
	3 => Load Plugin Module
	4 => Check for updates
	5 => Exit Creation Utility




											[ Building Custom Scripts ]

The entire purpose of Intersect 2.5 is to help you create custom post-exploitation scripts. This is done by using the
Create application and selecting option '1' from the Main Menu.
