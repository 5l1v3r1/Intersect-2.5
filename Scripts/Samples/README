Sample server-side shells

A few samples of server-side shells built using the build.py script.
Only difference will be the HOST, PORT and pin (if you created a xor shell).

You can use these to familarize yourself with how the shells operate, test out
some custom code of yours or just delete them. They are really just here as a place
holder for some upcoming stuff.
