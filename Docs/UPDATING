Documentation: How to Update the Intersect Framework

- How to update

How to update:
--------------
When you downloaded Intersect, whether it was from Sourceforge, Github, or
the SVN repo directly, it should have included the .svn subdirectory and a
script called 'update.py' within the main folder.

All changes and updates to the Github repo are mirrored onto the SVN.
When you execute, update.py it will check the SVN repo for any new files,
changes and other updates. These updates will be downloaded and installed
automatically.


Update timeline:
----------------

    The Intersect Framework is mirrored on Github as well as the SVN repo.
Development changes will be constantly pushed to Github through-out each
week. If you want to keep up with the development updates as they are rolled out,
you will need to either fork the Github repository or manually download the zip/tar.gz
file from Github. 

    The SVN repository is only updated to reflect the stable changes
once per week. The SVN will be updated every Monday morning at 7:15am.
If you execute update.py between the weekly updates are pushed to SVN,
you will not see any changes. A good way to handle weekly updates is to
plan on executing update.py every Monday morning to make sure you are
using the latest release.
