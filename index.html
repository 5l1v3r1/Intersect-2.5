        <h3><strong>Intersect 2.5 - Post-Exploitation Framework</strong></h3>

<p>Intersect 2.5 is a Linux post-exploitation framework written in Python. The main goal of this project is to assist penetration testers in the automation of many post exploitation and data exfiltration tasks that they would otherwise perform manually. </p><p>
    With the Intersect framework, users can easily build their own customized scripts from the pre-built templates and modules that are provided or they can write their own modules to add additional or specialized functionality. </p><p>
    The framework is centered around the Create application. This is where users can build their Intersect scripts, control the available modules and import their own. Using the Create application provides a very straight forward, menu-driven process for interacting with the framework.</p>

<p>You can use the menu shown above to navigate through the framework options. There are several pre-built samples of Intersect scripts availabe in the <code>Scripts/Custom</code> directory if you want to get a feel for what your final product will be like.</p>

<h3><strong>What are Modules?</strong></h3>

<p>The Modules are what provides the individual features of your custom script. Each module focuses on a certain aspect or task related to post-exploitation, remote access or data exfiltration. They are broken down into two separate categories, Standard and Custom. The Standard modules include all the original features of Intersect 2.0, such as gathering credentials, system and user information, creating tar archives of gathered information, searching for system or network protection measures and many more tasks.
</p><p>
The Custom modules are made up of anything outside the original Intersect 2.0 features. This is also where 3rd party or custom-written modules will be loaded once they are imported into the framework. Some examples of custom modules include various remote shells, MITM modules, web and SOCKS proxies, password cracking modules and network mapping.</p><p>

Anyone can write and import their own module which makes the framework very easy to expand upon and change to suite your specific needs. If you want more information on how to write your own module, there is a detailed guide in the documentation or the [framework wiki.](<a href="https://github.com/ohdae/Intersect-2.5/wiki/WritingModules">https://github.com/ohdae/Intersect-2.5/wiki/WritingModules</a>).
